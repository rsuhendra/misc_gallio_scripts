# Synpase localization

## synapses.ipynb
Input: an input neuron id, and an approximate point of 
interest (the middle of a cluster of neurons for example) 

Output: Postsynaptic neurons and how many synapses 
they share with the input neuron

There is also a visualization tool in the Jupyter notebook
to help you figure out how large a radius to keep synapses in.
